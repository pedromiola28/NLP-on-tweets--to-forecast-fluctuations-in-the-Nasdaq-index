# NLP on Tweets to forecast fluctuations in the Nasdaq index

The objective of this project was to forecast fluctuations in the Nasdaq Index using Bag of Words on Twitter data.

Twitter data was obtained with Octoparse, which was programed to collect data from the profiles of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Hilary Clinton, The Economist, Bloomberg Economics and Bill Gates, between 04/01/2020 to 10/01/2020. 

As classifier, Complement Naive Bayes was used. 

The best forecast, 76% accuracy, was achieved after spliting the data to obtain a dataset with balanced classes.
